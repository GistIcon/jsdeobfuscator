# Long description for addons.mozilla.org
description.long=Some websites use various tricks to prevent you from seeing the JavaScript code that runs there, often the code is downloaded from the server in obfuscated form or even generated on the fly. Or maybe the JavaScript codebase is simply too large to browse it easily. Yet the JavaScript engine still needs to know which code to run and that’s where JavaScript Deobfuscator gets its information from: it simply displays the scripts that the JavaScript engine compiles and executes. This makes it a useful tool even when working with web pages that don’t use obfuscation.\n\n<b>Source code / Contributing</b>\n\nThe extension source code is available under https://github.com/palant/jsdeobfuscator.
